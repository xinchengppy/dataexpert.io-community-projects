Thanks for the clear, well-structured submission. It’s evident you thought through ownership, on-call logistics, investor-critical timing, and realistic failure modes. The runbooks strike a good balance by listing symptoms/causes without recommending fixes, and your monitoring/alerting and cross-pipeline dependency sections show solid operational awareness.

What’s strong

    Structure and clarity: Easy-to-read Markdown; clean separation of ownership, on-call, runbooks, dependencies, and monitoring.
    Ownership and rationale: Logical pairing of related pipelines; clear primary/secondary assignment for all five pipelines.
    On-call design: Simple weekly rotation; holiday policy and swap/backup rules; explicit month-end heightened coverage.
    Runbooks for investor pipelines: Each includes purpose, data sources, owners, common issues with symptoms/causes, SLAs, and on-call notes. The issues listed are realistic and relevant.
    Monitoring and alerting: Good coverage of freshness, row count anomalies, NULLs, failures, and SLA breach warnings. Cross-pipeline awareness is well articulated.

Key areas to improve

    Ownership fairness versus stated rationale

    Gap: The rationale claims “critical investor pipelines [are] distributed across all engineers,” but primary ownership for investor pipelines is concentrated: DE1 (2 investor pipelines), DE3 (1), DE2/DE4 (0).
    Suggestion: Distribute investor primaries across all four (e.g., DE1: Profit, DE2: Engagement, DE3: Growth; DE4: Aggregate Investor/Executive rollup if it exists) or rotate investor primaries quarterly. Keep secondaries paired for continuity.

    On-call scope and consistency

    Clarify 24x7 vs business-hours coverage, time zones, and weekend expectations. Growth runbook mentions business hours only, but the global on-call section implies more continuous coverage.
    Define severity levels and escalation timers (e.g., Sev1 investor-report blocking: page immediately; Sev2 freshness at risk: 30 minutes; Sev3 data quality non-blocking: next business day). Four-hour wait to escalate to the team lead may be too long near month-end—tighten for Sev1.
    Standardize handoff: Make the 30-minute handoff meeting and checklist apply to the entire rotation, not just Engagement. Include links to dashboards, recent incidents, known risks, and any temporary suppressions.

    Runbook completeness (non-solution details)

    Add types of data processed beyond sources: fact/dimension entities, batch vs streaming mode, expected volumes (rows/day, events/sec), and PII classification.
    Add operational metadata: schedule/cadence, job IDs/DAG names, dependencies by job name, expected runtimes, SLIs/SLOs per pipeline (e.g., freshness target p95).
    First-responder checklists: Provide step-by-step triage that doesn’t prescribe fixes, e.g., where to check last successful run timestamp, how to verify upstream health, where to find error logs, and who to notify.
    Backfills: Specify safe backfill windows, watermark strategy, idempotency expectations, replay impact on downstream aggregates, and approval requirements near month-end.
    Schema/change management: Define schema contract ownership, registry or validation, notification process for producers (especially frontend), and a change freeze window around month-end.
    Communications: Add contacts and channels per pipeline (Finance/Accounting for Profit, Sales Ops/RevOps for Growth, Product/Frontend for Engagement), plus status update cadence during incidents.

    SLAs, SLIs, and alert harmonization

    Align pipeline-specific SLAs with alert thresholds. For example, Engagement allows 48 hours for data arrival, but global alerts mark >24 hours as critical—consider pipeline-specific thresholds.
    Differentiate standard vs month-end SLAs (tighter RTO/RPO during close). Consider a “close window” policy with enhanced paging and shorter escalation timers.

    Dependencies and investor-readiness

    Your dependency section is strong—add whether downstream aggregations block on missing upstream data or fall back (and how that’s flagged to stakeholders).
    Consider simple contract tests between pipelines (e.g., row-count deltas within bounds, non-null business keys) and enforce them in CI before deploys.

    Operational hygiene and governance

    Note data governance/PII handling (especially for Engagement). Document retention, masking, and access controls for production credentials and “break-glass” procedures.
    Define incident lifecycle: ticketing system, incident commander, postmortem template, and learning loop.
    Include the on-call calendar link and holiday calendar; explicitly note which locales’ holidays apply.

Minor nits

    In Profit and Growth, add reconciliation specifics (e.g., which GL or finance report is the source of truth) and expected variance thresholds during timing differences.
    For Engagement’s Spark OOMs and skew, list non-solution checks such as where to find skew metrics and stage-level logs.

If you need to remedy the submission quickly, please provide:

    A revised ownership table that evenly distributes investor pipeline primary ownership across all four engineers.
    A clear statement on on-call coverage hours (24x7 vs business hours), time zones, and weekend coverage.
    A standardized handoff checklist and escalation matrix with severities and timers.
    Per-pipeline operational metadata: schedule/cadence, job/DAG names, expected runtime windows, primary dashboards/log locations, and stakeholder contact lists.
    Backfill policy (window, watermarking) and schema/change management protocol (registry, approvals, freeze around month-end).
    Confirmation that alert thresholds are pipeline-specific and aligned with each pipeline’s SLAs.

Overall assessment This is a strong, thoughtful submission that covers the required elements and demonstrates good operational thinking. With clearer distribution of investor primaries, tighter/standardized on-call procedures, and a bit more operational metadata in the runbooks, this would be excellent.
